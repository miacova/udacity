Markup is a system for writing in a document in a different way in the text. 
The markup language is not shown, is only used to format the text.
<hr>
<p>ex: <em> Hello </em> the first tag is the opening (start) tag, the last tag is the closing (end) tag. </p>
<p>Did   you
   know?
      Spaces,
      tabs,
   and line
   breaks       are       called
         <strong>whitespace</strong> . </p>

<p>Talia lived in a fearsome jungle in the middle of the fearsome jungle.</p>
<p>Talia was the most fearsome of all, thought she was only a baby.</p>
